**IMPORTANT!!!**

These icons have been migrated to Eclipse.org's Git Revision Control System:

http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git

The icons are located in the org.eclipse.ui.images bundle. The renderer maven mojo is located in the org.eclipse.ui.images.renderer bundle.

This project provides a set of SVG icons designed after the <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a> project's existing icon set.

The current icons look great but are raster-based, without support for translucency and can not be scaled to arbitrary sizes for use on high resolution displays. This project intends to fix that.

Please note that the icons are currently incomplete and are a work in progress.

The icon sources and associated rasterization code are under the Eclipse Public License.
