SVG Icons for Eclipse

This project contains a set of SVG icons for Eclipse under the EPL. 
Please see LICENSE.txt for licensing and usage details.

To generate raster icons from the SVG set, simply run:

$ ant

from within the project directory.

To view which icons still lack an SVG version, you can run:

$ ant missing

This is print a list of icons where a .gif images exists but no 
similarly named .svg file.

While the icons should work with any capable SVG editor or viewer, 
Inkscape is the preferred tool, which is open source and available 
at: http://inkscape.org/.
